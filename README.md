# Sinhala unicode to Sinhala font real-time conversion for Word® and Photoshop®

This online application converts Sinhala Unicode text to Sinhala font structure too. What you input as Singlish will be converted to both Sinhala Unicode as well as to Sinhala font structure. If you want to use the converted Sinhala text in other applications such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop then you should copy the text in after turning the Sinhala Font switch on and then use it with a regular Sinhala font. The converted text is compatible with all DL type Sinhala fonts and many other Sinhala fonts available out there as well.
